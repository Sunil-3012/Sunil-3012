## 🚀 About Me

I'm a cloud-native developer passionate about designing secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure using AWS and DevOps best practices. With hands-on experience in tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible, I love building CI/CD pipelines, containerizing applications, and crafting cloud-first architectures that scale.

I'm currently pursuing my Master’s degree, while working on real-world projects in the cloud and DevOps space — many of which you’ll find in this GitHub profile!
